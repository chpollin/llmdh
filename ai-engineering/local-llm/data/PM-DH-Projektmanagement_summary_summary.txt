The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding principles for software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It was first published in 2001 by a group of developers who were dissatisfied with traditional software development methods. The manifesto advocates for an iterative approach to software development, where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing teams.
