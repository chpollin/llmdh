The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to project management where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. The phases are typically divided into separate stages, with each stage representing a distinct activity or set of activities. This model is often used in software development projects, where requirements gathering and analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment are clearly defined and follow a strict sequence.
