The Waterfall Methodology is a sequential approach to software development that follows the following phases:

1. Requirements gathering and analysis: In this phase, project stakeholders collect requirements for the system to be developed, and then analyze them to ensure they are complete, accurate, and feasible.
2. Design: The design phase involves creating a high-level architecture of the system, defining data models, interfaces, algorithms, and other technical specifications.
3. Development: In this phase, software developers build the system based on the design created in the previous phase. They write code, create databases, and test the system to ensure it meets requirements.
4. Testing: The testing phase involves verifying that the system works correctly and meets requirements. It includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and performance testing.
5. Deployment: In this phase, the completed software is deployed to the production environment, where users can access it and start using it.
6. Maintenance: The maintenance phase involves ongoing support of the system, including bug fixes, updates, security patches, and other enhancements. It also includes training end-users on how to use the system effectively.
